## Objectives
- ### After waiting for years and passing several tests, the Martian Aerospace Agency selected me to become part of the first human colony on Mars. As a prominent fintech professional, they chose me to lead a project developing a monetary system for the new Mars colony. I decided to base this new system on blockchain technology and to define a new cryptocurrency named **KaseiCoin**. (Kasei means Mars in Japanese.)

- ### **KaseiCoin** will be a fungible token that’s ERC-20 compliant.

- ### Optionally, I’ll launch a crowdsale that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.

---

## To Do
- ### [X] Create the KaseiCoin Token Contract

- ### [X] Create the KaseiCoin Crowdsale Contract

- ### [X] Create the KaseiCoin Deployer Contract

- ### [X] Deploy and Test the Crowdsale on a Local Blockchain

- ### [] Optional: Extend the Crowdsale Contract by Using OpenZeppelin

## Note
### **For deploying contracts use the following steps:**
#### 1. Open *Instructions* Folder
#### 2. Open *KaseiCoin.sol* File
#### 3. Copy code
#### 4. Open a new instance of Remix
#### 5. Paste copied code into Remix and compile
#### 6. Repeat steps 1-5 for the *KasesiCoinCrowdsale.sol*
#### 7. Deploy and run contracts
